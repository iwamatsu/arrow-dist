Description: data processing library for analysis - runtime
 Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data.
 It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for
 flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on
 modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy
 streaming messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently
 supported include C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
